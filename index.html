        <h2>Why Go To Paris</h2>
        <p>The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance. Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well. The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians, probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema.
  Containing world-class museums, fashion, cuisine and an atmosphere all its own, Paris is also a city of "many splendors," as Ernest Hemingway recalled in his memoir, "A Moveable Feast." Visit the beloved Musée d'Orsay, shop the biggest designers on the Champs Élysées or hit the boutiques in Le Marais, take in the view atop the Eiffel Tower, or even plan a day trip to Versailles Palace. But don't miss out on the simple pleasure of meandering the marvelous arrondissements (districts), or snacking on street crepes either.</p>


<p>The City of Light is not short on traditional cultural sorties, with world-class opera and ballet as well as revues spanning the comedic to the racy. But there is also a whole host of eclectic clubs for those wishing to continue revelries into the wee hours. Nightlife is concentrated in Pigalle (particularly trendy SoPi, or South Pigalle), around Canal Saint-Martin and Strasbourg Saint-Denis, and along the banks of the Seine in less tourist-trodden 12th and 13th arrondissements. Here, Telegraph Travel's Paris experts, Hannah Meltzer and Natasha Edwards, present their favourite after-hours spots.</p>

      <h2>Why Go To Yellowstone</h2>
      <p>With dramatic peaks and pristine lakes, Yellowstone National Park is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolored pools swirl around hot springs; verdant forests weave past expansive meadows; and volatile geysers launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, it's no wonder why everyone suspected John Colter (a scout for explorers Lewis and Clark) was embellishing when he first described Yellowstone's geothermal curiosities in 1807. Nowadays, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you traverse its 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, geysers and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies.</p>

      <p>Yellowstone National Park is home to more wild animals than almost anywhere else in the U.S., but it is not a zoo. Visitors are likely to see a number of animals in Yellowstone freely roaming the landscape in their natural habitat. Animals you might see include grizzly bears, gray wolves, the world's largest wild bison herd, bald and golden eagles, trumpeter swans, moose and more. Outside of Yellowstone, to the south and the northeast of the park, you can also see herds of wild horses.</p>

      <p>To explore Yellowstone’s wild side, get off the beaten path and onto the park’s 1,300-mile trail system. Some of the most popular hikes are Bunsen Peak, Mt. Washburn and Uncle Tom's Trail to the base of Canyon's Upper Falls. Do you have kids? Read our Top 3 Trails for Hiking With Kids article</p>

      <h2>Why Go To Rome</h2>
      <p>Few cities can rival Rome's astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing the top artists of the day and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums; Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in the city's art-rich churches; baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Walk around the centre and without even trying you’ll come across masterpieces by the giants of Western art – sculptures by Michelangelo, canvases by Caravaggio, Raphael frescoes and fountains by Bernini.</p>

      <p>A trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture. Idling around picturesque streets, whiling away hours at streetside cafes, people-watching on pretty piazzas – these are all an integral part of the Roman experience. The tempo rises as the heat of the day gives way to the evening cool and the fashionably dressed aperitivo (pre-dinner drinks) crowd descends on the city's bars and cafes. Restaurants and trattorias hum with activity and cheerful hordes mill around popular haunts before heading off to cocktail bars and late-night clubs.</p>

      <p>Eating out is one of Rome's great pleasures and the combination of romantic alfresco settings and superlative food is a guarantee of good times. For contemporary fine dining and five-star wine there are any number of refined restaurants, but for a truly Roman meal head to a boisterous pizzeria or convivial neighbourhood trattoria. These are where the locals go to dine with friends and indulge their passion for thin, crispy pizzas, humble pastas, and cool white wines from the nearby Castelli Romani hills. Then to finish off, what about a gelato followed by a shot of world-beating coffee?</p>

        <h2>Why Go To New york</h2>
        <p>New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square.</p>


      <p>Enjoy a seamless visit to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor. This tour benefits from early reserve-line access for a round-trip ferry trip, as well as an optional early morning departure time that puts you ahead of many sightseers. Your guide takes you through Lady Liberty’s pedestal and to its observation decks, as well as through the Great Hall exhibits at Ellis Island.</p>

      <h2>Why Go To Tehran</h2>
      <p>Though neither Iran’s oldest or prettiest city, the bustling metropolis of Tehran is not without its own compelling charm. Home to over 10 million Iranians, the largely concrete skyline is set against the breath-taking backdrop of the Alborz mountains which rise out of the smog below. Often underrated as a tourist destination, nowhere will you sample a flavour of contemporary Iranian life more than Tehran. Here we present 10 must-do-and-sees whilst in the capital.</p>

      <p>Right in the heart of the city, the Grand Bazaar is an essential visit for any tourist in Tehran. With over 10 kilometres of labyrinthine alleyways filled with covered shops, haggling customers, and general commotion, you will find everything from jewellery to carpets and pots and pans for sale here. One of Tehran’s oldest areas, this commercial centre is teeming with history and character, and there are some exceptional restaurants dotted around. Prepare for a sensual bombardment; not for the agoraphobic! Be sure to check out the nearby Jomeh bazaar for antiques, every Friday on Jomhuri Street.</p>

      <p>The bazaar in the northern district of Tajrish is smaller, prettier, and altogether less stressful than the Grand Bazaar (although prices are higher). There is a colourful market of fresh fruit and vegetables, and some excellent touristy shops selling traditional crafts and kitschy memorabilia. Check out the kebab restaurant in the centre of the bazaar, and the teahouse just off the main drag. It’s also worth visiting the stunning adjacent shrine, the Imamzadeh Saleh.</p>

It also features a contemporary painting of Queen Elizabeth II by Andrew Festing (1998). The large diorama in the centre of the entrance hall depicts the Royal Hospital as it looked in 1742. The museum itself includes a reconstruction of a typical berth, the uniform of a veteran soldier, and many other artefacts.</p>
